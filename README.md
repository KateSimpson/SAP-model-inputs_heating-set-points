# SAP-model-inputs_heating-set-points

Hi there,

This repository shares the inputs for the modelling within the paper titled 'Housing fabric retrofit: sensitivity analysis of carbon savings for householder appealing options'. 

The BERG SAP 2012 Python model used is available with full documentation via: https://sap2012.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

For any questions relating to the model inputs I used, please email [to be added after review]
Ideas for future work are also welcome.

Many thanks
